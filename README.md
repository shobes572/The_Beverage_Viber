## Description
> This project was built by Coffee and Tea aficionados.  The goal was to help with the ever internal debate of whether to have a steamy hot cup of tea, or that jittery goodness of Java Joe.  The beverage viber helps you decide if you'd like to have a Coffee or Tea, and will generate a recipe that coordiates with your choice. If you have no clue, well then let our random generator decide for you!    This was built using the node tools ```mysql2``` ``` express```  ```dotenv``` and ```sequelize```.

## Installation
> We pulled the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, aka ```package.json```, entered ```npm install``` , and then used the ```require``` method to direct the routes for each of the items within the directory.

## Contributions
> Team JSKC!! John-Mark Sackett, Shobair Abidi, Kira Griffitt, and Catherine Upperman.  We would like to thank our TA's Ross and Andrew for their help debugging, and general moral support. Oh and thanks to our teacher Dan, for always blaming Cat for everything that went wrong, and then helping us to fix it.
## Testing
> To test the data base we used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to run the different, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. We ran ```node server.js``` in the terminal multiple times to test the webpage, to ensure the look and functionality were there. Once we were mostly satisfied with the product, we pushed to heroku for deployment.
